# 4VGYM-API
I've created a restful API to manage "Cuatrovientos GYM", using symfony and doctrine ORM. Information about activities, monitors and activity types will be available in the API.
I have used a mysql database server, and followed OpenAPI specifications.

No extra packages or installations are needed.

I hope you find it useful. Best regards.
